<p>That day I was thinking about Devanshi(as usual), I thought "Hmmm... She talks to me for long hours, she definitely likes me, let's just cut to the chase and propose her", that day was 16th december 2021, I didn't even know she existed till 19th Nov 2021 and here I was, proposing her to be my girlfriend after just 29 days after meeting.</p>

<p>I had some lines saved with myself which I got from typing websites, I changed the names in those line and pasted it into the notes. I started writing whatever came to my mind, it came out to be a long message with 3 paragraphs, I don't think we are supposed to write this long messages on WhatApp but anyway, I sent it!</p>

<p>The reply was something anyone would've guessed. Infatuation did make the old Rishi blind, and I was rejected, I felt bad but deep down I knew this was coming.</p>

<p>She didn't answer with a plain "no", I don't think anyone could answer that to a 3 paragraph message. She told me that she liked talking to me but she was not looking for a boyfriend. "We could still be friends", she said.</p>

<p>I liked talking to her, we continued to be friends and now, we are best friends. Atleast that's what her mother thinks (khi khi).</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
