<p>That day I was thinking about Devanshi(as usual), I thought "Hmmm... She talks to me for long hours, she definitely likes me, let's just cut to the chase and propose her", that day was 16th december 2021, I didn't even know she existed till 19th Nov 2021 and here I was, proposing her to be my girlfriend after just 29 days after meeting.</p>

<p>I had some lines saved with myself which I got from typing websites, I changed the names in those line and pasted it into the notes. I started writing whatever came to my mind, it came out to be a long message with 3 paragraphs, I don't think we are supposed to write this long messages on WhatApp but anyway, I sent it!</p>

<p>The reply was something anyone would've guessed. Infatuation did make the old Rishi blind, and I was rejected, I felt bad but deep down I knew this was coming.</p>

<p>She didn't answer with a plain "no", I don't think anyone could answer that to a 3 paragraph message. She told me that she liked talking to me but she was not looking for a boyfriend. "We could still be friends", she said.</p>

<p>I liked talking to her, we continued to be friends and now, we are best friends. Atleast that's what her mother thinks (khi khi).</p>
